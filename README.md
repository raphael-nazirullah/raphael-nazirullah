# Hi there 👋
I'm a software engineer based in Pakistan. I've been working as a fullstack developer for the past 4 years (frontend heavy).
I'm currently on a career break, focusing on personal & professional development (the last company I worked at was [Vartana](https://vartana.com/) where I worked for 2+ years).

Hit me up if you'd like to collaborate on any project (especially open-source projects.
